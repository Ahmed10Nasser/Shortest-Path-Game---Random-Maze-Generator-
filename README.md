# Shortest-Path-Game---Random-Maze-Generator-
This project is mainly two parts:

--> First part is C++ code that contains mainly 2 algorithms:
1- Randomized BFS (Breadth First Search) Algorithm --> To generate Random Mazes
2- Dijkstra Algorithm --> To get the shortest path from the start point to the end point

--> Second part is The GUI (Graphical User Interface) that is done by HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP--> using some concepts in web game like tile mapping
